# Bamazon
Amazon node app that utilizes an SQL database to mimic an Amazon shopping app.
This app use the Node packages "mysql" and  "inquirer". SQL is used to host the database for that app that contains the products for our Bamazon store. Whenever you select a product the js code acesses the server to udpate the products. The inquirer package is what prompts the customer to choose what item they are trying to purchase and how much they would like to purchase. It also prompts the user if they would like to make another purchase after they are done with their current purchase.

You can pick from a list of 10 items, select how much of that item you want. Once you have selected the appropriate amount yout order is fulfilled and the databse is updated to refelect how much of the product you have purchased.
